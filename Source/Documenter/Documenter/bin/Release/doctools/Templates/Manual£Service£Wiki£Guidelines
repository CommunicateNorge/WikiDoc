<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>This page details the guidelines for how information should be structured in the Wiki portion of this framework.</p>

<h3>Manual section types</h3>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>This section of the Wiki is reserved for the documentation of the project and it's high-level components. Every entry here will typically have the same name as the
project itself and detail what the project should accomplish and its goals.</p>

<h4>External Services</h4>
<p>Details the external systems and services you project interacts with. This section is not for technical documentation (which is typically auto-generated) but for the
manual description of the service and its high-level connection to the project as a whole.</p>

<h4>Services</h4>
<p>This section is reserved for the internal services and systems created outside BizTalk solutions. An entry here should represent contain either links to or the documentation 
itself for the entire service. This is where you should link to your sandcastle documentation 
and describe the purpose of the service. You should also list all the services calling your service and describe how these interact. If the internal service is 
an API you should also link to the API usage documentation here.</p>

<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>This section simply describes the solution architecture.</p>

<h4>Deliveries</h4>
<p>This section details the state and content of deliveries of the system to support. You could typically add a list of the versions delivered and a plan of what to
be delivered and when.</p>

<h4>Release Management</h4>
<p>Details the build and deployment process for the relevant parts of the solution. This section should contain a step-by-step guide to deploying
and building all solutions.</p>

<h4>Support</h4>
<p>This section details all support features for the system and underlying services. It should contain entries for error handling, logging and all other relevant
support tasks and features.</p>

<h3>Automatic section types</h3>
<h4>BizTalk</h4>
<p>This section contains all BizTalk code documentation with an associated manual page for each documented component i.e. Orchestrations, Schemas etc.</p>
<p>You should use the manual pages to provide an overview of the components functionality in a broader context than the specified technical documentation.</p>

<h4>Database</h4>
<p>This section contains the database documentation per database with an associated manual page. </p>

<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>Templates gives you a checklist for different types of pages, which can help you to produce more cohesive documentation. More information on templates can be found 
 <a href="/Wiki/Page/Manual£Service£Wiki#wikimaler">here</a>.</p>
