<h2>Wiki-FAQ</h2>

<p>This page contains an overview of the frequently asked questions about functionality within this documentation wiki. We will try to keep this FAQ as simple as possible but to understand some of the features explained here some level of technical computer knowlage is required.</p>

<h3><a id="NewPage" name="NewPage"></a>How do I make a new page?</h3>

<p>To make a new page you click the &quot;New Page&quot; button on the top right corner of the page.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£newpage£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width: 500px; height: 326px;" /></p>

<p>After you click the button you are presented with the &quot;New page&quot; dialog. When creating a new page you are effectively&nbsp;limited to two levels. Select the first level and the second level appears. The levels correspond to the left side main menu so use that as a guide!</p>

<h3>Can I view a list of all the pages I&#39;ve edited?</h3>

<p>Yes! To view a list of pages you&#39;ve edited simply click your username in the upper right corner of the page, the one right below the logo banner.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£profilepg£jpg£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width: 469px; height: 72px;" /></p>

<h3>Ugh! I made a mistake, can I&nbsp;rollback a page?</h3>

<p>If you need to roll a page pack to a previous version you simply click the [History] link on the top left side of the page. This will take you to the &quot;History&quot; page where you can view all previous versions of the page as well as the person who saved them. This data is contained in the &quot;History&quot; table which looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£history_table_rollback£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width:500px" /></p>

<p>To rollback to a specified version just click the [Rollback] link in the right most cell of the table. A new version will then be created containing the version you roll backed from and the old version will be placed as the &quot;Current Version&quot;.</p>

<h3>This site is boring! Can i change it?</h3>

<p>Yes! We have newly implemented theme support. To change your theme you click your login-name in the top right corner of the page. And then you select the theme you want with the button menu.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£manual£Service£Wiki£Faq£themes€png" /></p>

<p>The theme of the site will change immediately and we will even remember your selection for you the next time you log on!</p>

<h3>How do I find stuff aka. search?</h3>

<p>To search this wiki you simply type whatever query you have into the search bar at the topmost left side of the page. When you press enter or click the button labeled &quot;Search&quot; you are, after a short wait, presented with your results in a view similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£serach_faq£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width:600px" /></p>

<p>The blue title is the name of the page that contains your query string. All results are sorted by relevancy, which is displayed in the bottom green text line. Relevancy is primarily calculated by query occurrence count per document. If you have multiple query words this is accounted for as well. The black line in between the aforementioned is the snippet taken from the first occurrence of your query inside the relevant document. It gets 100 characters before the match and after.</p>

<h3>Can I compare the content of two different pages?</h3>

<p>Yes! Allthough this is a bit of a hidden gem. Firstly find the name(last part of url) of the two pages you want to compare. Usually this would be two different versions of the same page, these urls can be found on a page&#39;s &quot;History&quot; page.</p>

<p>Then goto this url:&nbsp;<a href="https://tpdoc.azurewebsites.net/Wiki/Diff/">https://tpdoc.azurewebsites.net/Wiki/Diff/</a>&lt;page1&gt;<a href="https://tpdoc.azurewebsites.net/Wiki/Diff/">/</a>&lt;page2&gt;<br />
Example:&nbsp;<a href="/Wiki/Diff/Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ/Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£Version3">https://tpdoc.azurewebsites.net/Wiki/Diff/Manual&pound;Service&pound;Wiki&pound;FAQ/Manual&pound;Service&pound;Wiki&pound;FAQ&pound;Version3</a></p>

<h3><a id="flowcharts" name="flowcharts"></a>How about flowcharts and stuff?</h3>

<p>Awesome that you should mention that. There are several ways to add a diagram or chart to a page;</p>

<ol>
	<li>The simplest way is simply to link to an external site with your diagram (that&#39;s a bit boring though)</li>
	<li>You could embed a diagram from an external page using an iframe (a bit better, but, you know...&nbsp;external dependency :S&nbsp;).</li>
	<li>You could upload the diagram as an image using our awesome upload feature (that&#39;s cool, but not very interactive)</li>
	<li>Now, you might ask, wouldn&#39;t it be better with a vector based image? Yes, that&#39;s why you can also add an svg image (with links and stuff).</li>
	<li>Still not satisfied? Create a diagram on <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a> and save it as .html, then you can simply copy-paste the div-tags from it into a page and voila!.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Editing the index page</h3>

<h4>How to add a thumbnail to the index page?</h4>

<p>To add a thumbnail to the index page you click the &quot;Add new thumbnail&quot; button located in the top left corner of the page. This spawns a editable box in the first viable position for a new thumbnail on the page itself, and also automatically scrolls down to it. The box looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£edit_index_new_box£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width:600px" /></p>

<p>The edit box has 4 input fields that expects the following:</p>

<table class="simpleTable">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Field name</th>
			<th>Expected value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Url to image</td>
			<td>A link to the image to use as a visual aid to your thumbnail. Formatted like a normal link ie. &quot;http://www.isocket.eu/media/img-uncuted-common/iSocket-full-of-extra-features.jpg&quot; For internal links you should use the &quot;Link&quot; button on the page and copy the href tag ie. &quot;/Wiki/Page/Manual&pound;Project&pound;BiB&quot;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Title link</td>
			<td>The link you want a user to be redirected to when he clicks the title of the thumbnail.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Title</td>
			<td>The text of the title itself.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Text</td>
			<td>The body text of the thumbnail.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h4>How to edit a thumbnail?</h4>

<p>You can edit a thumbnail by clicking the &quot;Edit&quot; button on the relevant thumbnail. When you click on the button the thubnail transforms into an edit box with the same four inputs as the new thumbnail box, but now filled with the data already contained on the thumbnail. You can transform multiple thumbnails into edit boxes at a time but you cannot save more than one.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£edit_index_edit_box£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width:600px" /></p>

<h4>How to delete a thumbnail?</h4>

<p>Deleting a thumbnail is easy, you simply click the &quot;Delete&quot; button on the relevant element. A confirm dialog will appear and as soon as you confirm the thumbnail will disappear from the front page.</p>

<h4>How to view the history of the thumbnails?</h4>

<p>The front page thumbnails are generated as all other pages on the wiki; as HTML. So if you want to view the history or rollback to a previous version it&#39;s exactly the same as for all other pages on the wiki. The only difference is that you use the &quot;History&quot; button instead of a [History]-link.</p>

<h3>How to edit the Main Menu?</h3>

<p>To edit the Main Menu you simply click the &quot;Edit Menu&quot; button in the top right corner og the page.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£editmenuButton£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" /></p>

<p>You will then be presented with a menu looking something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/Images/UploadedImages/Image£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ£mainmenuedit£png£Manual£Service£Wiki£FAQ" style="width: 664px; height: 500px;" /></p>

<p>To edit a field in the menu simply change the text in that field and click save. To add a new field you type the name of your new page into the blank field with a plus sign in it and then click save.</p>

<h4>Finding your new page</h4>

<p>To find your new page you click the newly made link under the relevant main header. In this instance (Support). This will bring you to your page where you can click the [Link] field on the top of your page to get a relative link that you can use anywhere on this site.</p>
